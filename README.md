# CuddleManager

**CuddleManager** is a lightweight, terminal-based mod manager for Subnautica â€” built because Vortex felt too heavy and weird to use.

---

## ðŸ–¥ Compatibility

Right now, CuddleManager only works on **Windows**.

If it gets enough attention (or someone wants to help out), Linux/macOS support could happen in the future.

---

## ðŸš€ Usage

After installing globally with `npm install -g`, you can run:

```bash
cuddle <command>
